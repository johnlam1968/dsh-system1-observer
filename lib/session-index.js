// THE HAND-ROLLED SESSION INDEX, READ SIDE -- one home for the store's path, its tables and its queries.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The harness ships its own SQLite FTS index (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-query-sqlite`), and this
// deployment leaves it at `openAt: never`; enabling it in the profile made `api-session-controller` fail to start and
// the cause was never reproduced (`F98`). So the capability lives here, in a store this repository owns:
// `scripts/session-index.mjs` BUILDS it, and this module READS it -- used by that script's CLI and by
// `lib/sessions-tool.js`, so neither can drift from the other about a path, a column or a query.
//
// `node:sqlite` IS IMPORTED LAZILY, on the first read and never at module load. It is an experimental built-in that
// prints a warning when it loads, and the plugin's own startup must not carry a warning for a store that may not
// exist. That also keeps every function here usable in a process where the store is absent: each returns a NAMED
// problem instead of throwing.
//
// WHAT A SEARCH COVERS, and the list is not just messages: message text, reasoning, tool-call ARGUMENTS and tool
// RESULTS. The harness's own extractor covers tool traffic, and a search that read only messages answered "no
// matches" for a phrase that was sitting in a tool result -- measured while writing it.
